# Loan-Default-Classification
Loan default classification is the process of categorizing loans based on the likelihood of the borrower failing to repay them according to the agreed terms. It’s a crucial aspect of risk management in lending institutions. By accurately classifying loans into categories such as “low risk,” “medium risk,” or “high risk,” in our case “risk” or “No risk” Lenders can make informed decisions about loan approvals, interest rates, and the allocation of resources.

This classification is useful for several reasons:

1. Risk Management: It helps lenders assess the level of risk associated with each loan. Loans classified as high risk may require stricter terms or collateral, while low-risk loans may receive more favorable terms.

2. Profitability: By identifying and managing high-risk loans effectively, lenders can minimize losses due to defaults and improve overall profitability.

3. Regulatory Compliance: Many financial regulations require institutions to maintain certain levels of capital reserves based on the riskiness of their loan portfolios. Accurate classification ensures compliance with these regulations.

4. Customer Segmentation: It allows lenders to tailor their products and services to different customer segments based on risk profiles, thereby optimizing their offerings and attracting the right customers.

5. Portfolio Monitoring: Classification enables ongoing monitoring of loan portfolios, helping lenders identify early warning signs of potential defaults and take proactive measures to mitigate risks.
